# Azure vs AWS vs Google Cloud: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Azure

### 1. What is Microsoft Entra ID?

Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service. It helps employees, partners, and customers securely access resources such as:

- Microsoft 365

- Azure

- Applications (SaaS, custom, or on-prem)

- Internal company systems

It’s part of the broader Microsoft Entra product family, which includes services for identity governance, decentralized identity, and access management.

### 2. Microsoft Entra ID main feature and capabilities

#### 2.1. Single Sign-On (SSO)

Sign in once to access all applications (like Outlook, Teams, Salesforce, etc.).

Reduces password fatigue and improves user experience.

#### 2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Adds an extra layer of security beyond username and password.

Examples: SMS codes, authenticator apps, biometric login.

#### 2.3 Conditional Access

Control access based on conditions like user location, device health, or risk level.

Example: Block access from risky countries, or require MFA when outside the corporate network.

#### 2.4 Identity Protection

Uses machine learning to detect and respond to suspicious login attempts.

Can automatically block or challenge high-risk sign-ins.

#### 2.5 Application Management

Centralized portal to manage app access, provisioning, and security.

Integrates with thousands of prebuilt apps (Google Workspace, ServiceNow, etc.).

#### 2.6 Device Management Integration

Works with Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

Helps enforce policies like “Only allow corporate-managed devices”.

#### 2.7 B2B and B2C Identity

B2B: Collaborate with external partners by giving them secure access to your resources.

B2C: Create branded sign-in experiences for your customers.

#### 2.8 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Assign users roles that limit what they can do within applications and Azure resources.

#### 2.9 Lifecycle Management

Automate user provisioning and de-provisioning.

Sync with on-prem Active Directory if needed.

#### 2.10. Audit Logs and Monitoring

Track sign-ins, changes, and access history.
